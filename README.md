# `ssbu-less-lag`

idk man 3 frames less input lag than ultimate or something

## Known Issues (WIPs)

1. High fighter counts (>= 4) might cause frame skips. This means doubles, dittos of characters like Ice Climbers, Pokemon Trainer, and Aegis.
2. Certain stages might cause frame skips with the above fighters more often than other stages
3. Results screen might have frame skips
4. Final kill sparks might have frame skips

Until these issues are fixed this reassures that this mod is best used AS A PRACTICE TOOL on netplay to get closer to offline performance. Please do not use this in netplay tournaments for both you and your opponent's sake.

## Where's the USB Stuff?

The USB stuff requires some more polish, but considering that it's a very small amount of the overall input delay removed (roughly 2.5-5ms average), I would rather release this mod in it's current state and continue working on the others when I have time.

Thanks for understanding!
